# Chichester

A scraper for Virginia's Administrative Code.

Named for Cassius M. Chichester, the Director of Statutory Research and Drafting from 1946â€“1951, a founding member of the Commission on Code Recodification.

## Planned functionality

### Load TOC

Load `http://leg1.state.va.us/000/reg/TOC.HTM`.

Example TOC entry:

```html
<a href="/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+reg+TOC01017">Agency   17</a></td><td>DESIGN-BUILD/CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT REVIEW BOARD (ABOLISHED) </td>
```

From this, get the ID, agency number, title, and whether it's been abolished.

Use a regular expression a little like this:

```
/000\+reg\+TOC([0-9]+)">(^<)<\/a><\/td><td>(^<)/
```

Then save whether it's been abolished, and break that out of the title:

```php
if (stristr($title, '(ABOLISHED)') !== FALSE)
{
	$abolished = TRUE;
	$title = str_replace('(ABOLISHED)', '', $title);
	$title = trim($title);
}
```


### Load each agency TOC

The URL is like this: `http://leg1.state.va.us/000/reg/TOC18085.HTM`.

That format is: `http://leg1.state.va.us/000/reg/TOC[id].HTM`.

This is a list of chapters and those chapters' sections. We don't care about the chapters, but we do care about the sections.

Example agency TOC entry:

```html
<a href="/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+reg+18VAC85-20-10">Section 10</a></td><td>Definitions </td>
```

Use a regular expression a little like this:

```
/000\+reg\+(^")">(^>)<\/a><\/td><td>(^<)/
```

Then save whether it's been repealed, and break that out of the title:

```php
if (stristr($title, '[REPEALED]') !== FALSE)
{
	$repealed = TRUE;
	$title = str_replace('[REPEALED]', '', $title);
	$title = trim($title);
}
```

From this, get the complete section number, the described section number, the section title, and whether it's repealed.


### Load each section

Each URL is like this: `http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+reg+18VAC85-20-310`.

That format is: `http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+reg+[section_number]`.

These are the fields that we want to extract:

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>HTML Element</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>`p.part`</td><td>[unclear]</td></tr>
<tr><td>`p.vacno`</td><td>section number and title</td></tr>
<tr><td>`p.sectind`</td><td>the actual text of the regulation</td></tr>
<tr><td>`p.auth`</td><td>statutory authority</td></tr>
<tr><td>`p.history`</td><td>history</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
